# transmission-reseeder
The purpose of this reseeder it to make the adding of previously downloaded material easier.
Once you have downloaded the content once, the magnetLINK is copied into a special shell script
which can be executed, on its own, to seed the content with transmission-** torrent client.
The reseeder application simple collects all these ***.magnetLINK files and adds them to be seeded once again.

# Limitations
Because of the nature of the transmission, only the linux version works with these tools. The windows
and mac versions might be supported someday. When every these platforms allow transmission-remote to be used.
